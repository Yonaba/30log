30log
=====

__30log__, in extenso *30 Lines Of Goodness* is a minified framework for [object-orientation](http://lua-users.org/wiki/ObjectOrientedProgramming) in Lua.
It features __class creation__, __instantiation__, __inheritance__ .<br/>
And, it makes __30 lines__. No less, no more.

##Installation
Copy the file [30log.lua](https://github.com/Yonaba/30log/blob/master/Lib/30log.lua) inside your project folder, call it using [require](http://pgl.yoyo.org/luai/i/require) function.<br/>
When loaded, __30log__ returns its main function.

##Quicktour
###Creating a class
Making a new class is fairly simple. Just call the returned function, then add some properties to this class :

```lua
class = require '30log'
Window = class ()
Window.x, Window.y = 10, 10
Window.width, Window.height = 100,100
```

You can also shortcut it, passing the default properties as a table to <tt>class</tt> :

```lua
class = require '30log'
Window = class { width = 100, height = 100, x = 10, y = 10}
```

###Instances

Once a class is set, you can easily create new __instances__ from the class.

```lua
appFrame = Window:new()
print(appFrame.x,appFrame.y) --> 10, 10
print(appFrame.width,appFrame.height) --> 100, 100
```

You can also use a shortcut, calling the class __as a function__ :

```lua
appFrame = Window()
print(appFrame.x,appFrame.y) --> 10, 10
print(appFrame.width,appFrame.height) --> 100, 100
```

From the two examples above, you might have noticed that once an instance is created from a class, its properties takes __by default__ the class properties.
But, you can init objects from a class with your own specific properties. To accomplish that, you must have implemented a method named <tt>**__init**</tt> inside the base class.<br/>
In a nutshell, <tt>**__init**</tt> is the __default method__ to be used as a __class constructor__.

```lua
Window = class { width = 100, height = 100, x = 10, y = 10}
function Window:__init(x,y,width,height)
  self.x,self.y = x,y
  self.width,self.height = width,height
end

appFrame = Window:new(50,60,800,600)
   -- or appFrame = Window(50,60,800,600)
print(appFrame.x,appFrame.y) --> 50, 60
print(appFrame.width,appFrame.height) --> 800, 600
```

###Methods
__Methods__ are supported. Obviously.

```lua
Window = class { width = 100, height = 100, w = 10, y = 10}
function Window:__init(x,y,width,height)
  self.x,self.y = x,y
  self.width,self.height = width,height
end

function Window:set(x,y)
  self.x, self.y = x, y
end

function Window:resize(width, height)
  self.width, self.height = width, height
end

appFrame = Window()
appFrame:set(50,60)
print(appFrame.x,appFrame.y) --> 50, 60
appFrame:resize(800,600)
print(appFrame.width,appFrame.height) --> 800, 600
```

###Inheritance
A class can __derive__ from a base class using a default method named <tt>:extends</tt>.
The new class will inherit his mother class default __members__ and __methods__.

```lua
Window = class { width = 100, height = 100, x = 10, y = 10}
Frame = Window:extends { color = 'black' }
print(Frame.x, Frame.y) --> 10, 10

appFrame = Frame()
print(appFrame.x,appFrame.y) --> 10, 10
```

A derived class can __overload any method__ defined in its base class (or mother class). Therefore, the derived class still has access to his mother class methods via a special key named <tt>super</tt>.<br/>
Let's use this feature to build a class constructor for our <tt>Frame</tt> class.

```lua
-- The base class "Window"
Window = class { width = 100, height = 100, x = 10, y = 10}
function Window:__init(x,y,width,height)
  self.x,self.y = x,y
  self.width,self.height = width,height
end

function Window:set(x,y)
  self.x, self.y = x, y
end

-- A derived class named "Frame"
Frame = Window:extends { color = 'black' }
function Frame:__init(x,y,width,height,color)
  -- Calling the superclass constructor
  self.super.__init(self,x,y,width,height)
  -- Setting the extra class member
  self.color = color
end

-- Overloading Window:set()
function Frame:set(x,y)
  self.x = x - self.width/2
  self.y = y - self.height/2
end

-- A appFrame from "Frame" class
appFrame = Frame(100,100,800,600,'red')
print(appFrame.x,appFrame.y) --> 100, 100

appFrame:set(400,400)
print(appFrame.x,appFrame.y) --> 0, 100

appFrame.super.set(appFrame,400,300)
print(appFrame.x,appFrame.y) --> 400, 300
```
