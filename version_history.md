#Yonaba's 30log Version history#

##1.3.0 (10/24/16)
* Added `class:create`, which allocates a new instance without invoking the class initializer
* Added 30log-commons
* Updated specs

##1.2.0 (03/10/2016)
* Added `class:cast()`, changes the class of an instance

##1.1.0 (09/26/2016)
### New features
* Added `class:subclasses()` returns the list of all classes which extend from `class`
* Added `class:instances()`, returns the list of all instances of `class`
* Added `class:classOf()`, checks if `class` is a superclass of arg
* Added `class:subclassOf()`, checks if `class` is a subclass of arg
* Added `instance:instanceOf()`, checks if `instance` is an instance of arg
* Added `class:without()` to remove a mixin from a class
* Added `class:with()`, includes a mixin to a class

### Breaking changes
* Changed implementation of `class.isClass`, now only checks if arg is a class
* Changed implementation of `class.isInstance`, now only checks if arg is an instance
* Removed `class:include()`
* An instance of `class` is considered to be the instance of any superclass of `class`
* A class is considered to be the subclass of any of its direct superclass's superclasses
